    Accurate Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) prediction is a central challenge in intelligent transportation systems, navigation services, and mobility applications. Existing approaches based on static routing algorithms or trajectory-driven machine learning improve over simple baselines but often fail to account for drivers’ intended routes and the dynamic evolution of traffic interactions. These limitations restrict their ability to deliver reliable estimates under congested and heterogeneous traffic conditions.This work presents a dynamic spatio-temporal graph neural network that integrates vehicle-level dynamics, junction states, and explicit route intent within a unified Mixture-of-Experts framework. The transportation network is represented as a multi-relational graph, combining static road edges with dynamic vehicle interactions and planned route segments. Temporal dependencies are modeled through sequential graph snapshots, enabling the system to capture both persistent infrastructure characteristics and evolving traffic behaviors. Evaluation on a large-scale simulated dataset shows that the proposed model reduces Mean Absolute Error (MAE) from a simple average-time baseline of 260 seconds to 46 seconds, corresponding to an 82\% improvement. In contrast, representative trajectory- and graph-based baselines typically achieve only moderate gains in the range of 40–50\%. These results underscore the importance of explicit route representation and dynamic spatio-temporal modeling for accurate and robust ETA prediction.
