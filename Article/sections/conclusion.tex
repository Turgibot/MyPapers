\section{Conclusion}
We presented a dynamic, intent-aware graph approach to ETA prediction, combining spatio-temporal encoding with a mixture-of-experts. Experiments indicate that explicit route intent and expert specialization improve accuracy. Future work will validate on real-world data and explore policy feedback between ETA and route selection.
